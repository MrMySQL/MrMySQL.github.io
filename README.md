<a href="http://MrMySQL.github.io">Multistream for twitch.tv</a>

My first little jQuery project to watch two or more twitch streams simultaneously. Created 3 years ago.

unfinished:
- more usefull UI (resizable windows, go back button in games catalog, chats in tabs)
- more usefull routing like domain.com/streamname1/streamname2/streamname3/streamname4
